**What's unique about this version of Conway's Game of Life?**

It is generalized to apply to multiple dimensions.

That is, you can input any dimensions value from 1 to 10. 10 is an arbitrary cutoff on the high end, mostly to limit the size of the grid. Visualization is difficult but still very possible for dimensions higher than 3.

I used TDD (Test-Driven Development) and showed usage of multiple common Java (and OOP) concepts in practice, like design patterns, an abstract class, properties loading, and unit tests.

To use this implementation, download the repo and read the README Instructions.txt file. You can view and compile the code yourself, or simply run it using the compiled seebald_game_of_life.jar file provided. This code was written in Java 7, and you can build it using the build.xml Maven file.
